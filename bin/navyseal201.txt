******* Patch Information ***********

    Gooseman: "
    This is the Navy Seals Weapons compilation patch. I'm not sure which
    version you're playing right now but the Final version is intended
    to replace all 8 of the original Quake weapons with weapons
    taken directly from the arsenal of the Navy Seals special ops division.
    Some of these weapons include : Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun,
    mossberg tactical shotgun, Heckler & Koch Mk. 23 handgun, and
    the M-16 Assault Rifle (with grenade launcher attached :-).
    This mod has been a true labour of love. I've gone through MANY
    revisions on each gun and may yet to go through more revisions..
    suffice to say, the version of Navy Seals you're playing right now
    contains the most current revision of my gun and hopefully the
    most accurate. I first started this weapons mod back in Early June
    with the intention of only doing an M-16 but after I got blasted for
    such shoddy craftsmanship I decided to show those who blasted me that
    I can do it right (hopefully).
    "

***********************
*       FEATURES      *
***********************

   - Heckler & Koch Mk. 23 : This is the handgun that recently won the
       SOCCOM project. Soon , all special ops forces in the USA will be
       using this gun. IT uses .45 calibre bullets and carries 12 bullets
       in its clip.
       Due to the method in which the bullets travel the gun is best used
       at close range where maximum torque on the bullet can severely
       hurt the intended victim. At ranges greater than 20 feet the
       power of the bullet dissipates quite rapidly..
       Expect to see 1/4th of the power at a range greater than 200 feet.

   - Mossberg 590 tactical shotgun : I don't know much about this shotgun
       other than the fact that it's a 12 gauge and uses shells.

   - Heckler & Koch MP5 Submachine gun : The world famous MP5 submachine
       gun has become a staple in all special ops forces in the USA.
       It's stability while firing, durability, and ease of use make
       it the predominant submachine gun in the world. The MP5 fires 9mm
       rounds and carries 30 bullets in its clip.

   - Colt M-16 Assault Rifle : Standard issue assault rifle in the USA.
       The M-16 fires 5.56 mm NATO bullets and carries 30 bullets in
       its clip just as in real life. The grenade launcher attached to
       the barrel uses 1 rocket per grenade launch and is fired by
       invoking 'impulse 101'.

   - PSG-1
       At a cost of $5,000 per rifle, the PSG-1 defines itself as
       THE MOST ACCURATE semiautomatic sniper rifle in production.
       With a $1,200 scope, it's obvious that HK weren't skimping out
       anywhere! The PSG-1 clip carries 20 rounds of .308 bullets.

   - M60
       With a top rate of fire in excess of 500 rds/minute the M60 can
       lay down an impressive amount of lead in a very short time frame.
       The M60 fires 7.62 mm NATO specified bullets and has a 200
       round belt.

   - H&K MP5 SD
       silencer equiped version of MP5 described above. You will be issued
       this weapon as soon as you receive your second MP5.

   - M16 RAW
       M16 equiped with anti-armor rocket launcher. You will be issued with
       this weapon as soon as you receive your second M16.

   - Barrett
       Barrett sniper rifle. You will be issued with
       this weapon as soon as you receive your second Barrett.

*****************************
*  Known bugs in 2.0.1      *
*****************************
- GLQuake crashes when running Navy SEALs 2.0 (problems with meshing
  a number of the new models for weapons)
- selecting the Barrett sniper rifle looses the MK23 handgun (probably
  a bitfield overflow)
- obituary messages for players killed by handgrenades mention
  any weapon but a handgrenade


*****************************
*  How to use Modification  *
*****************************

1) make a directory in your REGISTERED quake directory called "navyseal"
2) unzip the file nseal201.zip into the new directory you've just created
   with the -d option (ie. type "pkunzip nseal201.zip -d" . This will
   unzip the file with regards to recursive directories.)
3) Now depending on which version of Quake you plan on running
   (regular Quake or GLQUake) you might have to run the batch file
   included in the /progs directory. If you are running normal Quake then
   you DO NOT run that batch file. If you are running GLQuake then you
   SHOULD run that batch file. Basically the batch file just
   swaps the 2 .mdl's
4) Now , go to the Quake directory and type "quake -game navyseal" or
   "glquake -game navyseal" if you're runnning GLQuake.
